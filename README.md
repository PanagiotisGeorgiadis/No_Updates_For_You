# No Updates For You! :fire:

After countless times of Windows Update ( forcefully :tired_face:) restarting my machine, its time to say NO MORE! :punch:  
We should be able to restart our machines whenever we feel like it !


Choose your destiny with one of the following commands:

```
npm start slow    -- Attempts to abort a shutdown every 30 minutes.
npm start normal  -- Attempts to abort a shutdown every 15 minutes.
npm start fast    -- Attempts to abort a shutdown every 5 minutes.
npm start insane  -- Attempts to abort a shutdown every 1 minute.
```

Note: If you don't provide any flags, it will default to `normal`.

Enjoy!
